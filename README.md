This is a working draft of the CERES (https://ceresproject.eu/) vulnerability analysis (Task 5.3) looking the climate risk of fish and fisheries in Europe. The repository contains both processing and analysis scripts, as well as the draft report / manuscript, in the form of bookdown. The rendered bookdown version of the report can be viewed at https://bookdown.org/markpayneatwork/ceres_vulnerability/



## Setup
* This project employs the convention the working directory in R should be set to the top directory of the project i.e. where this README.md file can be found. Using a project in the RStudio IDE largely takes care of this.
* This repository is only for source files - input data, intermediate objects, and output data, including bookdown outputs, should not be tracked under version control due to their large size
