15;Herring, capelin and cod in the Barents and Norwegian Sea;27.1, 27.2;HER, COD, CAP;moderate;The low climate hazard of these stocks is offset by the poor profitability (high vulnerability) of the fleets.
16;Pelagics and Demersals in the Baltic Sea;27.3;COD, HER, SPR;moderate;In spite of the low hazard of these stocks, moderate-high specialisation (moderate-high exposure) and poor profitability (high vulnerability) generate a moderate climate-risk.
17;Autumn spawning herring (Clupea harengus) in the North Sea;27.4;HER;moderate;A wide distribution of hazards is balanced by the moderate specialisation (exposure) and profitability of the fleets.
18;Gadoids (Cod, Haddock, Hake, Saithe) in the North Sea;27.4;COD, HAD, POK, HKE;moderate-high;The high hazard of the stocks offsets the good profitability (low vulnerability) of the fleets.

20;Flatfish in the North Sea;27.4;PLE, SOL;moderate-high;High climate hazard of the stocks is only partially offset by moderate profitability (vulnerability).
21;Dolphinfish in the Mediterranean;37.1, 37.2, 37.3;DOL;variable;Poor profitability (high vulnerability) is offset by the general nature of the fleets (low exposure) of the fleets, resulting in fleet-specific climate-risks.
22;Anchovy and Sardine in the Bay of Biscay;27.8;ANE, PIL;low;Low climate hazard of the stocks are strengthed by the general nature (low exposure) and moderate profitability (vulnerability) of the fleets.
23;Small pelagics in the northwest Mediterranean Sea;37.1;ANE, PIL, SAA;low;Good profitability (low vulnerability) and the general nature (low exposure) of the fleets, offset the moderate hazards of the stocks.
24;Hake in the Aegean Sea;37.3;HKE;high;Poor profitability (high vulnerability) combines with the moderate-high hazard of the stocks to give a high climate risk.s.
25;Bluefin Tuna in the Northwest Mediterranean;37.1;BFT;low;Low climate hazard of the stocks are strengthed by the general nature (low exposure) and moderate-high profitability (low vulnerability) of the fleets.
