# CERES Vulnerability Analysis

2019.10.07
First draft finally finished.

2019.09.18
Lots of work on the regional catch data. This is tricky.
  
2019.09.17
Added fleet risk results section. Largely finished with this section. Need to work on the regional analyses now

2019.09.16
Revised and updated fleet analysis post ASC. Still needs to be some work done on defining the metrics though....

2019.09.13
Major rewrite and modification of text. Updated code and text  all the way through to the end of the biological section.

2019.09.12
Lots of funkiness around the regional data. Merged the EUMOFA and EUROSTAT data sets into one common data set that can then be used as the basis for calculating regional metrics. 
Followed by very productive day working with John. Ready now to start the next iteration.

2019.09.11
Moved processing of STECF data into setup script. Tidied up the calculation of the biological metrics. Added calculation of risk all the way through at fleet level => First complete analysis

2019.09.10
Added regional catch diversity metrics (exposure) and some basic vulnerability metrics. Need to expand this some more, but we at least have a workflow here now. Also added fleet economic vulnerability, meaning that we have nearly complete region and fleet data - we just need to agree with John which metrics to include

2019.09.09
Implemented John's fleet exposure metrics.

2019.08.29
More or less completed the biological component.  Now move on to other components

2019.08.21
Slow progress on the Aquamaps front, trying to figure out exactly what to do next. Talking to John helped though. Here's the list
. Make a figure showing the calculation of TSM and warming rate spatially for e.g. cod, with FAO polygons overlaid on top
. Tidy up the biological metrics and send to John
. Finish finding the missing species - John and Georg may also be useful to help here.

Progress on tidying up the trait-based processing - seems to be more or less in place now. There are few things of Manja's that I can't replicate, but it is otherwise close. Started working on the Aquamaps now, which is going ok.
* Check for correct use of ifelse throughout code
* Implement Aquamaps extraction, maybe by area

2019.08.19
Worked on merging Manja's work into the workflow. It's a bit hard to follow at the moment.

2017.07.17
Worked on recovering this analysis from the May 2017 laptop failure. We had a reasonable starting point with ~50% of the code, and an output example. THis has allowed us to start to rebuild - in particular, a lot of the code to do with the EUROSTAT data has been recovered, which is particularly useful. Now proceeding to rebuild rest of it.
* Load in Laurene's LHS data
* Now ready to calculate per species vulnerabilities
* Then calculate national averages
