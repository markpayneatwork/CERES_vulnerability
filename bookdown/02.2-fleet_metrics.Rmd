According to the EU Data Collection Regulation (DCR), a fleet segment is defined by the gear code and the vessel length category

* FISHING_TECHNIQUE=gear codes -see codes below
* VESSEL_LENGTH=vessel length class -see codes below. 

It defines the minimum and maximum vessel length of fleet segment.The segmentation to level 2 is defined in Appendix III of the Commission Regulation 1639/2001, to level 3 in Appendix VIII and to level 4 in Appendix X.

### Fishing Fleet Hazard

TODO:
* STECF provides the catches of each species from each FAO subarea (ie. for each stock) for each fleet segment
* We weight the biological hazard score for each stock by the proportion of the value of landings coming from that stock for each fleet ie

$$ H_{fs} = \frac{\sum_{st}{V_{st,fs}H_{st}}}{\sum_{st}{V_{st,fs}}}$$
where $H_{fs}$ is the hazard of fleet segment $fs$, $V_{st,fs}$ is the value of landings from each stock for each fleet segment, and $H_{st}$ is the hazard of stock $st$.

### Fishing Fleet Exposure

Fleet segments are more likely to be sensitive to climate change if they are highly dependent on a climate-vulnerable natural resource. Many authors have assumed that fleets, ports or fishing communities have higher resilience if they catch a wide range of fish species, rather than concentrating on a specific resource. In order to calculate such indices for the EU fishing fleets we made use of the catch statistics provided by the EU Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). This yielded complete data for 423 fleet segments, as defined under the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF) and used throughout in the Annual Economic Report (AER). A fleet segment is the combination of a particular fishing technique category and a vessel length category.Landings data for the base year of 2016 were aggregated to the fleet-segment (FS) level. Following this, two indices were calculated, “Shannon diversity of fisheries landings”and “Simpson’s dominance of fisheries landings”.

The Shannon statistic ($ShannonH_{fs}$) is one of the most commonly used diversity indices in ecology. The formula for calculating the index for each fleet segment is

$$ ShannonH_{fs} = - \sum_{sp}{p_{sp,fs} \ln{p_{sp,fs}}}$$

where $p_{sp,fs}$ is the proportion of landings of species $sp$ in fleet segment $fs$. $p_{sp,fs}$ is  calculated from the species and fleet segement resolved landings $L_{sp,fs}$ as $p_{sp,fs}=\frac{L_{sp,fs}}{L_{fs}}$, where $L_{fs}=\sum_{sp}{L_{sp,fs}}$ is the total landings of that fleet segment.

Simpson’s dominance index (D) is another widely used statistic which, as the title implies, emphasizes the relative abundance of the commonest species in the sample, i.e. it measures the degree of dominance by a few key species. As D increases, dominance increases and therefore evenness and diversity decreases. The equation and calculation are as follows:

$$D_{fs} = \sum_{sp}{\frac{L_{sp,fs}(L_{sp,fs}-1)}{L_{fs}(L_{fs}-1)}}$$

Note that, in the present analysis, high diversity ($ShannonH_{fs}’$) of landings at the fleet segment level is thought to characterize fishing fleets that are less sensitive to climate change whereas fleet segments that exhibit higher dominance ($D_{fs}$) are thought to be more sensitive and hence these two indices have been scaled accordingly.

A composite index of fleet segement exposure $FE$ was calculated as an unweighted average of the two indices described above. Resulting values were normalized and scaled to range from 0 to 1, with higher values reflecting greater sensitivity.

### Fishing Fleet Vulnerability

We used four metrics of fishing fleet vulnerability

* Employment per vessel = `Full-time equivalent (harmonised)` / `Total number of vessels`
* Value of landings per vesssel = `Value of landings` / `Total number of vessels`
* Average wage per FTE = `Wages and salaries of crew` / `Full-time equivalent (harmonised)` 
* Net profit margin, which was calculated as described in the 2018 Annual Economic report: briefly, this corresponds to Net profit margin = 

These metrics were calculated for all years in which the fleet was active, and then averaged over the period 2011-2015. A combined vulnerability score was produced by rescaling all four metrics to have a range from 0 to 1, and averaging the result.
