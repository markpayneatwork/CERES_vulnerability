According to the EU Data Collection Regulation (DCR), a fleet segment is defined by the gear code and the vessel length category

* FISHING_TECHNIQUE=gear codes -see codes below
* VESSEL_LENGTH=vessel length class -see codes below. 

It defines the minimum and maximum vessel length of fleet segment.The segmentation to level 2 is defined in Appendix III of the Commission Regulation 1639/2001, to level 3 in Appendix VIII and to level 4 in Appendix X.

### Fishing Fleet Exposure

Fleet segmentsare more likely to be sensitive to climate change if they are highly dependent on a climate-vulnerable natural resource. Many authors have assumed that fleets, ports or fishing communities have higher resilience if they catch a wide range of fish species, rather than concentrating on a specific resource. In order to calculate such indices for the EU fishing fleets we made use of the catch statistics provided by the EU Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). This yielded complete data for 423 fleet segments, as defined under the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF) and used throughout in the Annual Economic Report (AER). A fleet segment is the combination of a particular fishing technique category and a vessel length category.Landings data for the base year of 2016 were aggregated to the fleet-segment (FS) level. Following this, two indices were calculated, “Shannon diversity of fisheries landings”and “Simpson’s dominance of fisheries landings”.

The Shannon statistic ($H’$) is one of the most commonly used diversity indices in ecology. The formula for calculating the index is

$$ H´ = - \sum{p_i \ln{p_i}}$$
where $n_i$ is the biomass of each species, $N$ is the total biomass of all species, and $p_i$ the proportional abundance of the $i$th species $\frac{n_i}{N_i}$.

Simpson’s dominance index (D) is another widely used statistic which, as the title implies, emphasizes the relative abundance of the commonest species in the sample, i.e. it measures the degree of dominance by a few key species. As D increases, dominance increases and therefore evenness and diversity decreases. The equation and calculation are as follows:

$$D = \sum{\frac{n_i(n_i-1)}{N(N-1)}}$$
Note that, in the present analysis, high diversity ($H’$) of landings at the fleet segment level is thought to characterize fishing fleets that are less sensitive to climate change whereas fleet segments that exhibit higher dominance ($D$) are thought to be moresensitive and hence these two indices have been scaled accordingly.

A composite index of Fisheries Exposure [FE] was calculated as an unweighted average of the twoindices described above. Resulting values were normalized and scaled to range from 0 to 1, with higher values reflecting greater sensitivity.
