# Introduction {#intro}

Some notes and points to include

*  Pecl / Hare approach 
  + Requires collection of expertise
  + Could be challenging to implement at the European scale
  + Note that most instances of this approach have been within a single jurisdiction and/or insitute e.g. NOAA, CSIRO, and now IMR
  + Instead, we apply a generic trait-based approach that can be carried out in the absence of detailed biological knowledge of response, relying on information that is widely and publically available
