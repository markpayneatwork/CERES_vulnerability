### Regional catch diversity

EUMOFA provides monthly "First-sale" records on a harbour-by-harbour basis for around 16 (???) European countries, plus Norway and Iceland. We take advantage of this high spatial resolution to examine the climate hazard on the NUTS2 geographical resolution scale. We first merged the EUMOFA first-sales data with geographical metadata (the longitude and latitude of each harbour) provided by EUMOFA, and use this spatial context to associate the harbour with the nearest NUTS2 region. We then integrated the value of landings over these regions for each of the approximately 100 "main commercial species"  (MCS) that EUMOFA monitors, and then averaged over the period of interest, 2011-2015. This analysis results in a database of the value of each MCS grouping for each NUTS2 region. Following the approach applied to the fleets, Shannon diversity indices (H) and Simpson's dominance indices (D) were then calculated for each NUTS2 region, and the combined metric used as measures of sensitivity.
