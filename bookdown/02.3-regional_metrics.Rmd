### Regional units

TODO: Desirable to have a higher spatial resolution than national level.

The EU Market Obsevatory for Fisheries and Aquaculture (EUMOFA) provides monthly "First-sale" records on a harbour-by-harbour basis for 16 European countries including Norway. We take advantage of this high spatial resolution to examine the climate hazard on a sub-national level, focusing on the NUTS2 regional units where possible. We first merged the EUMOFA first-sales data with geographical metadata (the longitude and latitude of each harbour) provided by EUMOFA, and used this spatial context to associate the harbour with the nearest NUTS2 region. We then integrated the value of landings over these regions for each of the approximately 100 "main commercial species"  (MCS) that EUMOFA monitors, and then averaged over the period of interest, 2011-2015. 

TODO: For countries not covered by EUMOFA.....

We generated a comparable database of landings for these countries based on the "EUROSTAT catch" dataset. We first aggregated the species resolution in EUROSTAT data from FAO species codes to the "Main commercial species" (MCS) groupings used by EUMOFA, based on correlation keys provided by EUMOFA, to enure comparability between these data sets.

### Regional hazard

Calculating a regional climate-hazard score requires information about the fisheries and landings at this spatial scale. Due the fact that we are basing this risk analysis and our hazard definition on stocks, rather than species,  this implies that we need not just information about the species composition in each region, but also the fishing area (FAO Subarea) where these fish were caught. We have two sources of information that approach this level of detail. The EUMOFA catch data gives species composition at the harbour level (which can then be aggregated into NUTS2 regions), but there is no indication where these fish were caught, making it difficult to link up to a stock. Alternatively, the "EUROSTAT catch" data provides catches by species and fishing region, but is only resolved at the national level. 

We therefore need to infer the distribution of stocks making up the landings of that species in that region region. 
In the absence of such data, we consider two different approaches. The first approach ("Method 1") assumes that the stock composition for a given species in a region mirrors that at the national level. We have information from the "EUROSTAT catch" database about the stock composition per species at the national level and can therefore use this as a key that we apply across all harbours and regions.

The second approach ("Method 2") assumes that landings in each region come from the waters immediately adjacent. For example,  a harbour fronting on to the North Sea will see landings of North Sea cod and herring, rather than Barents Sea cod and Norwegian Sea herring. Matching up the terrestial administrative regions with the nearest stocks allows the stock composition for each species in a region to be set, and therefore the regional hazard calculated. We can test the validity of this assumption using an internal consistency test. The "EUROSTAT catch" database provides the landings per country from each stock and these should therefore match the sum of the landings across all regions. Differences between the two will arise from stocks further away being landed in a region i.e. non adjacent regions. The results of this internal consistency check are shown in the Supplementary material.

In the end it may not be all that important because the only thing that varies by region (stock) is the safety margin and that of course is highly correlated in space so it may not matter at the end of the day.


### Regional exposure

 Following the approach applied to the fleet segments, Shannon diversity indices (H) and Simpson's dominance indices (D) were then calculated for each NUTS2 region, and the combined metric used as measures of regional exposure.
