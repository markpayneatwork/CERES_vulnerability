### Regional units

TODO: Desirable to have a higher spatial resolution than national level.

The EU Market Obsevatory for Fisheries and Aquaculture (EUMOFA) provides monthly "First-sale" records on a harbour-by-harbour basis for 16 European countries including Norway. We take advantage of this high spatial resolution to examine the climate hazard on a sub-national level, focusing on the NUTS2 regional units where possible. We first merged the EUMOFA first-sales data with geographical metadata (the longitude and latitude of each harbour) provided by EUMOFA, and used this spatial context to associate the harbour with the nearest NUTS2 region. We then integrated the value of landings over these regions for each of the approximately 100 "main commercial species"  (MCS) that EUMOFA monitors, and then averaged over the period of interest, 2011-2015. 

TODO: For countries not covered by EUMOFA.....

We generated a comparable database of landings for these countries based on the "EUROSTAT catch" dataset. We first aggregated the species resolution in EUROSTAT data from FAO species codes to the "Main commercial species" (MCS) groupings used by EUMOFA, based on correlation keys provided by EUMOFA, to enure comparability between these data sets.

### Regional hazard

TODO: Weighted the biological hazard of each stock by landings of each stock per region.

### Regional exposure

 Following the approach applied to the fleet segments, Shannon diversity indices (H) and Simpson's dominance indices (D) were then calculated for each NUTS2 region, and the combined metric used as measures of regional exposure.
