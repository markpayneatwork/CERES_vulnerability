# Methods

## Analysis approach

The vulnerability analysis performed here follows the "new" risk-assessment framework developed by the IPCC in the Fifth Assessment Assessment report (AR5). This framework focuses on the climate-risk, which consists of the vulernability, exposure and climate hazard. In this work we consider two primary focii areas that are at risk from climate change - European fishing fleets and European regional communities. 

TODO: Define fleets and communities  (??)

Both of these sectors are at risk from the impacts of climate change on the living marine resources upon which they depend. The biological impacts therefore form the base of this analysis (Figure xxx) and we consider two different mode of biological response. Firstly, species-specific harzards arise due to the  inherent traits of the organism that can make it more, or less, sensitive to climate change. Secondly, the response also depends on the spatial context: a population of a given species that is close to its  physiological upper thermal limit will be much more sensitive to warming than a population that is in the middle or colder part of its range. The combination of species-level information with the spatial context allows us to calculate the stock- (or population-) specific hazards that form the basis of this analysis.

The stock-specific hazards then propigate into the two main focii areas in different ways. In the case of the fleet analysis, this happens via the relative composition of the stocks that that each fleet fishes on, while in the case of the regional analysis it happens via the composition of the species that are landed in that region. These two different hazards are then combined with relevant vulnerability and exposure metrics to determine the overall climate risk in each focal area.

We focus primarily on "negative" effects of a changing climate resulting from warming temperatures.  We do not consider the effect of other processes, such as ocean acdificatio, deoxygenation or other changes in the ocean system. We also consciously exclude the effect of cooling temperatures in some regions associated with climate change, which only impacts a minor fraction of the ocean. We also deliberately focus on "negative" of climate change to aid interpretation of the final results. Many climate vulnerability or risk analyses fail to adequately distinguish between positive and negative effects of climate change, and simply highlight elements of their study system that will change, without saying which direction. Such an approach can be difficult to interpret, and we therefore make a conscious decision to focus on "negative" impacts, so as to ease interpretation of the results.
