CERES Vulnerability Analysis
==================================
TODO:
* [ ] Manually implement  Rapana venosa aquamap for the Black sea
* [ ] Associate coastal cells with FAO areas. 1. Identify the maximum cell area (land free) versus latitude 2. Deviations from this indicate the presence of land. Mark as such 3. Associate oceanic cells with FAO areas. 4. Associate coastal cells with FAO areas using st_within_distance (?)
* [ ] Check when the other 9 or so species went (down to 148). Possibly similar problems to Rapana spp.
* [ ] John has calculated fleet exposure using landings weight. Landings value may be more appropriate. Agree on a representative year for this.

Implemented John's fleet exposure metrics.

More or less completed the biological component.  Now move on to other components

Slow progress on the Aquamaps front, trying to figure out exactly what to do next. Talking to John helped though. Here's the list
. Make a figure showing the calculation of TSM and warming rate spatially for e.g. cod, with FAO polygons overlaid on top
. Tidy up the biological metrics and send to John
. Finish finding the missing species - John and Georg may also be useful to help here.

Progress on tidying up the trait-based processing - seems to be more or less in place now. There are few things of Manja's that I can't replicate, but it is otherwise close. Started working on the Aquamaps now, which is going ok.
* Check for correct use of ifelse throughout code
* Implement Aquamaps extraction, maybe by area

2019.08.19
Worked on merging Manja's work into the workflow. It's a bit hard to follow at the moment.

2017.07.17
Worked on recovering this analysis from the May 2017 laptop failure. We had a reasonable starting point with ~50% of the code, and an output example. THis has allowed us to start to rebuild - in particular, a lot of the code to do with the EUROSTAT data has been recovered, which is particularly useful. Now proceeding to rebuild rest of it.
* Load in Laurene's LHS data
* Now ready to calculate per species vulnerabilities
* Then calculate national averages
