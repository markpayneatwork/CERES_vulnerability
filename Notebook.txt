CERES Vulnerability Analysis

Slow progress on the Aquamaps front, trying to figure out exactly what to do next. Talking to John helped though. Here's the list
. Make a figure showing the calculation of TSM and warming rate spatially for e.g. cod, with FAO polygons overlaid on top
. Tidy up the biological metrics and send to John
. Finish finding the missing species - John and Georg may also be useful to help here.

Progress on tidying up the trait-based processing - seems to be more or less in place now. There are few things of Manja's that I can't replicate, but it is otherwise close. Started working on the Aquamaps now, which is going ok.
* Check for correct use of ifelse throughout code
* Implement Aquamaps extraction, maybe by area

Worked on merging Manja's work into the workflow. It's a bit hard to follow at the moment.

Worked on recovering this analysis from the May 2017 laptop failure. We had a reasonable starting point with ~50% of the code, and an output example. THis has allowed us to start to rebuild - in particular, a lot of the code to do with the EUROSTAT data has been recovered, which is particularly useful. Now proceeding to rebuild rest of it.
* Load in Laurene's LHS data
* Now ready to calculate per species vulnerabilities
* Then calculate national averages
